## Current Status: Phase 6 - Compose UI Components üîÑ

### What We've Accomplished
- ‚úÖ **Complete Authentication Engine**: All core authentication components implemented
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Storage Framework**: Platform-specific secure storage interfaces and factories
- ‚úÖ **OAuth Integration Framework**: Full OAuth flow management with PKCE support (interfaces ready)
- ‚úÖ **Biometric Authentication Framework**: Framework and platform-specific interfaces ready
- ‚úÖ **Platform Detection**: Complete platform detection utilities
- ‚úÖ **gRPC Integration**: Complete gRPC client interfaces and service definitions
- ‚úÖ **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive testing infrastructure with mocks
- ‚úÖ **Clean Repository**: Build artifacts removed and comprehensive .gitignore in place

### What's Ready for Implementation
üîÑ **Phase 6: Compose UI Components**
- All backend services are complete
- All authentication flows are implemented
- Ready to build user interface components
- Ready to create authentication screens

### Next Steps
1. **Begin Phase 6**: Start Compose UI component development
2. **Create Authentication Screens**: Login, Register, Forgot Password
3. **Implement OAuth UI**: OAuth flow components
4. **Add Biometric UI**: Biometric authentication interface
5. **Continue iterative development** with regular commits and testing

## Technical Decisions & Architecture

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Central EventBus for decoupled communication
- Comprehensive event hierarchy for all authentication operations
- Async event handling with coroutines

### Security Features
- PKCE flow for OAuth (framework ready)
- Secure token storage with platform-specific encryption (interfaces ready)
- Biometric authentication support (framework ready)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Multiplatform Strategy
- Maximum code sharing in common module
- Platform-specific implementations only where necessary
- Consistent interfaces across platforms
- Factory pattern for platform detection

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for provider interactions
- Platform-specific test implementations
- Mock providers for development and testing

## Repository Management
- Clean separation of source code and build artifacts
- Comprehensive .gitignore for KMM projects
- Regular commits at completion of each phase
- Proper branch management for features

## Cursor Development Instructions

### üéØ **FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY:**

1. **PHASE-BASED DEVELOPMENT**: Work on ONE phase at a time. Do not skip phases.

2. **COMMIT FREQUENCY**: Commit code after completing each major component within a phase.

3. **TESTING REQUIREMENT**: Every component must have corresponding tests before marking as complete.

4. **PROGRESS TRACKING**: Update this development plan file after completing each phase.

5. **CODE QUALITY**: Follow Kotlin best practices, use proper error handling, and maintain clean architecture.

### üìã **Current Task: Complete Phase 6 - Compose UI Components**

**Step 1: Authentication Screen Components**
- Create Login screen with email/password fields
- Create Register screen with user registration form
- Create Forgot Password screen with email input
- Implement form validation and error handling

**Step 2: OAuth Flow UI Components**
- Create OAuth provider selection UI
- Implement OAuth flow progress indicators
- Add OAuth error handling and user feedback
- Create OAuth callback handling

**Step 3: Biometric Authentication UI**
- Create biometric prompt interface
- Implement biometric setup and configuration
- Add biometric error handling and fallback options
- Create biometric settings UI

**Step 4: Profile and Settings UI**
- Create user profile management interface
- Implement settings and preferences UI
- Add account linking/unlinking interface
- Create responsive design for different screen sizes

### üîÑ **Development Workflow for Cursor:**

1. **Read the current phase requirements** from this plan
2. **Implement one component at a time** with proper testing
3. **Update the plan** after completing each component (add checkmarks)
4. **Commit code** after each major milestone
5. **Move to next phase** only after current phase is 100% complete
6. **Never skip phases** or mark incomplete work as done

### üìù **Progress Update Format:**
When updating this plan, use this format:
```markdown
- [x] Component Name - Brief description of what was implemented
- [ ] Component Name - Still needs implementation
```

### üö´ **What NOT to do:**
- Don't mark items as complete without actual implementation
- Don't skip testing requirements
- Don't move to next phase until current is done
- Don't ignore error handling or edge cases

## Implementation Status Details

### Phase 4 Components Status:
- **SecureStorage**: ‚úÖ Interface + Base class + Factory + Mock implementation
- **OAuthManager**: ‚úÖ Complete framework + PKCE + Platform interfaces
- **BiometricManager**: ‚úÖ Complete framework + Platform interfaces
- **Platform Detection**: ‚úÖ Complete utilities + Feature support
- **Factories**: ‚úÖ StorageFactory + BiometricFactory

### Phase 5 Components Status:
- **gRPC Client**: ‚úÖ Complete interface + Base class + Mock implementation
- **Service Definitions**: ‚úÖ Authentication + User Management + Token Validation
- **Testing Framework**: ‚úÖ Base test class + Mock implementations + Sample tests
- **Error Handling**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive error codes + Utility functions

### Ready for Phase 6:

- Error handling comprehensive

## Notes for Cursor
- Phase 4 is now complete with all framework interfaces
- Ready to proceed with Phase 5 (gRPC integration)
- Platform-specific implementations can be added incrementally
- Focus on one phase at a time
- Ensure all components are properly tested
- Maintain clean repository structure
- Update this plan file after each completion
