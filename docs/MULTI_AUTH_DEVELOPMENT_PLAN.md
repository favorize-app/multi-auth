# Multi-Auth Development Plan

## Project Overview
Creating a robust, event-driven multi-authentication system for Kotlin Multiplatform with Compose Multiplatform support. The system will support Google OAuth, email/password, and phone/SMS authentication with pluggable interfaces.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Architecture & Foundation âœ…
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Gradle configuration for KMM
- [x] Core domain models (User, AuthState, AuthError, etc.)
- [x] Event-driven architecture foundation
- [x] Basic interfaces for providers
- [x] Logger utility
- [x] Development plan documentation

### Phase 2: Provider Interfaces and Mock Implementations âœ…
- [x] EmailProvider interface and mock implementation
- [x] SmsProvider interface and mock implementation
- [x] OAuthProvider interface and mock implementation
- [x] Provider factory pattern
- [x] Mock implementations for testing

### Phase 3: Authentication Engine âœ…
- [x] AuthEngine - main authentication orchestrator
- [x] SessionManager - user sessions and token management
- [x] ValidationEngine - token and permission validation
- [x] AuthStateManager - centralized state management
- [x] Event system enhancements
- [x] Error handling improvements
- [x] Mock implementations for testing

### Phase 4: Platform-Specific Implementations âœ…
- [x] SecureStorage interface and BaseSecureStorage
- [x] Platform-specific storage implementations:
  - [x] AndroidSecureStorage (EncryptedSharedPreferences)
  - [x] IosSecureStorage (Keychain)
  - [x] WebSecureStorage (HttpOnly cookies + localStorage)
- [x] StorageFactory with platform detection
- [x] OAuthManager with PKCE support
- [x] Platform-specific OAuth implementations:
  - [x] AndroidOAuthProvider (Chrome Custom Tabs/WebView)
  - [x] IosOAuthProvider (ASWebAuthenticationSession)
  - [x] WebOAuthProvider (Popup/Redirect/Embedded)
- [x] BiometricManager framework
- [x] Platform-specific biometric implementations:
  - [x] AndroidBiometricProvider (BiometricPrompt/FingerprintManager)
  - [x] IosBiometricProvider (LocalAuthentication)
  - [x] WebBiometricProvider (WebAuthn API)
- [x] BiometricFactory with platform detection
- [x] Comprehensive .gitignore for KMM build artifacts

### Phase 5: gRPC Integration & Testing ðŸ”„
- [ ] gRPC client interface design
- [ ] gRPC service definitions
- [ ] Authentication service integration
- [ ] Token validation service
- [ ] User management service
- [ ] Integration testing framework
- [ ] Unit tests for core components
- [ ] Platform-specific test implementations

### Phase 6: Compose UI Components
- [ ] Authentication screens (Login, Register, Forgot Password)
- [ ] OAuth flow UI components
- [ ] Biometric authentication UI
- [ ] Profile management UI
- [ ] Settings and preferences UI
- [ ] Responsive design for different screen sizes
- [ ] Theme and styling system

### Phase 7: Advanced Features & Polish
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- [ ] Social login integration
- [ ] Account linking
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Internationalization (i18n)
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation

### Phase 8: Production Readiness
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Error monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Deployment automation
- [ ] Production testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Release preparation

## Current Status: Phase 5 - gRPC Integration & Testing

### What We've Accomplished
- âœ… **Complete Authentication Engine**: All core authentication components implemented
- âœ… **Comprehensive Storage Framework**: Platform-specific secure storage for all platforms
- âœ… **OAuth Integration**: Full OAuth flow management with PKCE support
- âœ… **Biometric Authentication**: Framework and platform-specific implementations
- âœ… **Clean Repository**: Build artifacts removed and comprehensive .gitignore in place

### What We're Working On
ðŸ”„ **Phase 5: gRPC Integration & Testing**
- gRPC client interface design
- Service definitions and integration
- Testing framework setup
- Unit and integration tests

### Next Steps
1. **Complete Phase 5**: Finish gRPC integration and testing
2. **Move to Phase 6**: Begin Compose UI component development
3. **Continue iterative development** with regular commits and testing

## Technical Decisions & Architecture

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Central EventBus for decoupled communication
- Comprehensive event hierarchy for all authentication operations
- Async event handling with coroutines

### Security Features
- PKCE flow for OAuth
- Secure token storage with platform-specific encryption
- Biometric authentication support
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Multiplatform Strategy
- Maximum code sharing in common module
- Platform-specific implementations only where necessary
- Consistent interfaces across platforms
- Factory pattern for platform detection

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for provider interactions
- Platform-specific test implementations
- Mock providers for development and testing

## Repository Management
- Clean separation of source code and build artifacts
- Comprehensive .gitignore for KMM projects
- Regular commits at completion of each phase
- Proper branch management for features

## Notes for Cursor
- Follow the iterative development approach
- Commit code at completion of each phase
- Update this plan as progress is made
- Focus on one phase at a time
- Ensure all components are properly tested
- Maintain clean repository structure
