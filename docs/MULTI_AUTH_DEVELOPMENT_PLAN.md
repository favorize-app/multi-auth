### What's Ready for Implementation
üîÑ **Phase 7: Advanced Features & Polish**
- All core authentication is complete
- All UI components are implemented
- Ready to add advanced features and polish
- Ready to implement MFA and social login integration

### Next Steps
1. **Begin Phase 7**: Start advanced features and polish
2. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: TOTP, SMS, backup codes
3. **Add Social Login Integration**: Enhanced OAuth flows
4. **Implement Account Linking**: Connect multiple authentication methods
5. **Continue iterative development** with regular commits and testing

## Technical Decisions & Architecture

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Central EventBus for decoupled communication
- Comprehensive event hierarchy for all authentication operations
- Async event handling with coroutines

### Security Features
- PKCE flow for OAuth (framework ready)
- Secure token storage with platform-specific encryption (interfaces ready)
- Biometric authentication support (framework ready)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Multiplatform Strategy
- Maximum code sharing in common module
- Platform-specific implementations only where necessary
- Consistent interfaces across platforms
- Factory pattern for platform detection

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for provider interactions
- Platform-specific test implementations
- Mock providers for development and testing

## Repository Management
- Clean separation of source code and build artifacts
- Comprehensive .gitignore for KMM projects
- Regular commits at completion of each phase
- Proper branch management for features

## Cursor Development Instructions

### üéØ **FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY:**

1. **PHASE-BASED DEVELOPMENT**: Work on ONE phase at a time. Do not skip phases.

2. **COMMIT FREQUENCY**: Commit code after completing each major component within a phase.

3. **TESTING REQUIREMENT**: Every component must have corresponding tests before marking as complete.

4. **PROGRESS TRACKING**: Update this development plan file after completing each phase.

5. **CODE QUALITY**: Follow Kotlin best practices, use proper error handling, and maintain clean architecture.

### üìã **Current Task: Complete Phase 7 - Advanced Features & Polish**

**Step 1: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Implement TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) generation and validation
- Add SMS-based MFA with verification codes
- Create backup code generation and validation system
- Implement MFA setup and configuration UI

**Step 2: Enhanced Social Login Integration**
- Add more OAuth providers (Microsoft, GitHub, etc.)
- Implement OAuth account linking and unlinking
- Add social login analytics and tracking
- Create enhanced OAuth error handling

**Step 3: Account Linking and Management**
- Implement multiple authentication method linking
- Add account recovery and backup options
- Create account security settings and preferences
- Implement account deletion and data export

**Step 4: Security and Performance Polish**
- Add security audit logging and monitoring
- Implement rate limiting and brute force protection
- Add performance optimization and caching
- Create comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### üîÑ **Development Workflow for Cursor:**

1. **Read the current phase requirements** from this plan
2. **Implement one component at a time** with proper testing
3. **Update the plan** after completing each component (add checkmarks)
4. **Commit code** after each major milestone
5. **Move to next phase** only after current phase is 100% complete
6. **Never skip phases** or mark incomplete work as done

### üìù **Progress Update Format:**
When updating this plan, use this format:
```markdown
- [x] Component Name - Brief description of what was implemented
- [ ] Component Name - Still needs implementation
```

### üö´ **What NOT to do:**
- Don't mark items as complete without actual implementation
- Don't skip testing requirements
- Don't move to next phase until current is done
- Don't ignore error handling or edge cases
